# Y KART - E-Commerce Platform

Y KART is a modern e-commerce web application built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Firebase. It allows users to browse products, add them to their cart or wishlist, place orders, and manage payments. The admin panel provides tools to manage products, orders, and analytics.

## Admin Credentials
For testing or administrative access, use the following credentials:
- **Email:** `yages@store.com`
- **Password:** `yages@1234`

**Note:** These credentials are hardcoded in `js/app.js` for admin login validation. In a production environment, avoid hardcoding credentials and rely solely on Firebase Authentication with proper security rules.



## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yages2003/YKART.git
   cd YKART
